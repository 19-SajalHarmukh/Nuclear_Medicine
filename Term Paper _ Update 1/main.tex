\section*{Aim}
To study and summarise the recent advancement and the emerging research on the use of nanoparticles in the biomedical imaging and to lookout for an early detection and diagnosis of the disease, which is the driving force in the field of medical imaging.

\section*{Introduction}
Nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanosphere, nanoshells, and nanostars, are
very commonly used in biomedical imaging.They make excellent drug carriers, imaging contrast agents, photothermal agents, photoacoustic agents, and radiation dose enhancers, among other applications. Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the use of nanomaterials
in many areas of functional imaging, cancer therapy.\\ Nanoparticles 1 â€“ 100 nm in diameter have dimensions comparable to biological functional units. Diverse surface chemistries, unique magnetic properties, tunable absorption and emission properties, and recent advances in the synthesis and engineering of various nanoparticles suggest their potential as probes for early detection of diseases such as cancer.
 
\section*{Task}
To go via various research papers to study the preliminary use of nanoparticles.
\\ To find papers targeting the particles use of nanoparticles and the advancement in medical imaging.
\\ To understand the use of different types of nanoparticles.
